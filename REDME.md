# get multiple lan connection througt one ethernet connetion 

we need ethernet and POE 

It shuld be speck  conform  (at least a bit and that it do  not destroy too mutch :3 )

use old poe 1 standard  :3 

than you  have 4 wires for POE in 2 pairs for  vcc and grond. 
you  cant divide them caus this cause trouble. 
but you  can modulate dlan  onto  them  caus poe 1  is compatible from  12 -48  v at least. 

there is a product for that called FlowWire 
you  can  use direct connection of 1:1  flowire or 1:9 on older standards

your poe device shuld work with  it. 
Becaus of several  reasons.
a all  your poe devices use a dc dc-converter internaly to step -down  your input from a specifiyd range to 3.3 or less voltage for internal  logic. 

you  can take out your flowwire with the opponent  device.
the  last  question is dos the feald of the modulation destroy the other things in ethernet? 
I dont know 
we have multiple pros and con's
